## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1 and 1.2 implementation:
- InputForm component exists at `src/components/InputForm.jsx` with URL input and business category selection
- React + Tailwind CSS stack is established and working well
- FastAPI backend at `/api/projects` endpoint handles project creation
- Database models support user projects with URLs and business categories
- Comprehensive testing patterns established with Jest and pytest
- Mock authentication system in place for development

### Architecture Requirements
**Frontend Framework and Styling:** [Source: architecture/frontend.md]
- Framework: React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design required for mobile-first approach

**UI Module Requirements:** [Source: architecture/frontend.md#UI Modules]
- InputForm: Already exists, accepts website URLs and business type
- Dashboard: Will display prompt progress and score summary (future story)
- Need to create foundational layout for future components

**System Overview Context:** [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]
- AEOBooster is a web application for AI chatbot visibility optimization
- Core workflow: Input → Website crawling → Prompt generation → LLM testing → Scoring → Optimization report
- Need to communicate this workflow clearly to users

### Non-Functional Requirements
**Responsive Design:** [Source: prd/5-non-functional-requirements.md]
- Mobile-first UI requirement
- App must be responsive across all device types

**Target Users:** [Source: prd/3-target-users.md]
- Small business owners, SEO professionals, marketers, startups
- Need clear, professional interface that builds trust

### Component Specifications
**Layout Components to Create:**
- Main application shell with responsive layout
- Header component with branding
- Progress indicator for multi-step workflow

- **File**: `src/components/UI/ProgressIndicator.jsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed aria-valuemax to use actual steps count
  - **Why**: Ensures screen readers announce correct progress information
  - **How**: Updated aria-valuemax and aria-label to use `progressSteps.length`

- **File**: `src/components/UI/ProgressIndicator.jsx`
  - **Change**: Added PropTypes for type safety and documentation
  - **Why**: Improves developer experience and catches prop-related bugs
  - **How**: Added comprehensive PropTypes definitions for all component props

- **File**: `src/components/UI/ErrorMessage.jsx`
