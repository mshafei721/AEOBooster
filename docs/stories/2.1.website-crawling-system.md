# Story 2.1: Website Crawling System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,  
**I want** to crawl the provided URL(s) and extract structured content like product pages, services, blog posts, metadata, etc.,  
**so that** I can gather the necessary website data for AEO analysis and optimization scoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system can accept a project ID and crawl the associated website URL(s)
2. The crawler extracts structured content including page titles, descriptions, headings, and main text content
3. The system identifies and categorizes different page types (product pages, service pages, blog posts, etc.)
4. Crawled content is stored in the database with proper relationships to the project
5. The crawler handles common website structures and respects robots.txt
6. The system provides progress feedback during the crawling process
7. Error handling for unreachable URLs, timeouts, and malformed content
8. The crawler extracts metadata (title tags, meta descriptions, structured data)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.3 implementation:
- FastAPI backend established with project creation at `/api/projects` endpoint
- Database models exist for Users and Projects with `id`, `user_id`, `site_url`, `created_at` fields
- React frontend can initiate analysis and track progress
- Progress indicator component available for showing crawling status
- Error handling patterns established for API failures

### Architecture Requirements

**Backend Framework:** [Source: architecture/backend.md]
- Framework: FastAPI
- Primary crawler engine: Playwright (with BeautifulSoup fallback)
- Scrape metadata, content, titles, descriptions
- Async queue for rate limiting and control

**Database Schema:** [Source: architecture/storage.md]
- Database: PostgreSQL (SQLite for local dev)
- Existing tables: Users, Projects
- New tables needed: Entities (id, project_id, type, value)
- Future tables: Prompts, Reports

**System Architecture:** [Source: architecture/system-overview.md]
- Core workflow: Input → Website crawling → Prompt generation → LLM testing → Scoring → Optimization report
- AEOBooster helps businesses optimize websites for AI chatbot visibility
- Uses prompt simulation and scoring methodology

**Infrastructure:** [Source: architecture/infrastructure.md]
- Backend: Render or Railway hosting
- Database: Supabase / Railway PostgreSQL
- Jobs: Async FastAPI tasks (or Celery + Redis for complex scenarios)

### Technical Implementation Details

**Crawler Service Specifications:**
- Use Playwright for JavaScript-heavy sites requiring rendering
- BeautifulSoup as lightweight fallback for static content
- Implement proper User-Agent rotation and respectful crawling delays
- Extract structured data including JSON-LD, microdata, and Open Graph tags
- Handle pagination and multi-page content discovery

**Content Classification Logic:**
- URL pattern matching for page type detection (e.g., /products/, /services/, /blog/)
- Content-based classification using keyword analysis
- Structured data parsing for enhanced page type identification
- Confidence scoring system for classification accuracy

**File Locations:**
- `src/services/crawler_service.py` - Main crawler implementation
- `src/services/content_extractor.py` - Content parsing and extraction
- `src/services/page_classifier.py` - Page type classification logic
- `src/models/crawled_content.py` - Database models for crawled data
- `src/api/crawl.py` - API endpoints for crawling operations
- `tests/test_crawler.py` - Comprehensive crawler tests
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test HTML files and mock websites

**Database Models to Create:**
```python
class CrawledPage(Base):
    id: int
    project_id: int (foreign key)
    url: str
    title: str
    meta_description: str
    content: text
    page_type: str
    confidence_score: float
    status: str (crawled, failed, pending)
    crawled_at: datetime
    
class PageContent(Base):
    id: int
    page_id: int (foreign key)
    content_type: str (heading, paragraph, list, etc.)
    content_text: text
    position: int
    
class CrawlJob(Base):
    id: int
    project_id: int (foreign key)
    status: str (pending, running, completed, failed)
    pages_crawled: int
    total_pages: int
    started_at: datetime
    completed_at: datetime
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- Network timeout handling (30-second default)
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Graceful handling of 404s, 403s, and other HTTP errors
- Content parsing error recovery
- Robots.txt compliance verification

**Performance Considerations:**
- Concurrent crawling with configurable worker limits
- Memory-efficient content storage for large websites
- Database connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios
- Caching mechanisms for repeated URL analysis

### API Integration Points

**Frontend Integration:**
- Existing InputForm component submits to `/api/projects` 
- Need to integrate crawling initiation after project creation
- ProgressIndicator component available for showing crawl status
- ErrorMessage component for handling crawl failures

**Backend API Design:**
```python
# Start crawling
POST /api/projects/{project_id}/crawl
Response: {"job_id": str, "status": "started"}

# Check crawling progress  
GET /api/projects/{project_id}/crawl/status
Response: {
    "job_id": str,
    "status": "running|completed|failed", 
    "pages_crawled": int,
    "total_pages": int,
    "current_url": str
}

# Get crawled content
GET /api/projects/{project_id}/content
Response: {
    "pages": [
        {
            "id": int,
            "url": str,
            "title": str,
            "page_type": str,
            "content_preview": str
        }
    ]
}
```
