# Story 1.2: Business Category Selection

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to optionally select my business category to better tailor prompts,  
**so that** the AEO analysis can generate more relevant and targeted prompts for my specific industry.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can select from a predefined list of business categories (e.g., E-commerce, SaaS, Local Services, Healthcare, etc.)
2. The business category selection is optional - users can skip this step
3. Selected category is stored with the project for use in prompt generation
4. The UI clearly indicates this step is optional
5. Category selection integrates seamlessly with the existing URL input flow

  - [x] Add business category dropdown/select component below URL input
  - [x] Populate dropdown with predefined business categories

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- InputForm component already exists at `src/components/InputForm.jsx`
- API endpoint `/api/projects` is already set up with Pydantic validation
- Database models use SQLAlchemy with proper relationships
- Frontend uses React with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Mock authentication is in place for development
- Comprehensive test structure already established

### Data Models
**Projects Table Schema Update:** [Source: architecture/storage.md#Projects]
- Existing fields: `id`, `user_id`, `site_url`, `created_at`
- **New field to add**: `business_category` (nullable string)

**API Request Update:** [Source: architecture/backend.md#Services]
- POST /api/projects current: `{ "site_url": "https://example.com" }`
- **Updated to**: `{ "site_url": "https://example.com", "business_category": "optional_category" }`

### API Specifications
**POST /api/projects (Updated)** [Source: architecture/backend.md#Services]
- **Existing behavior**: Creates new project with URL(s) for analysis
- **Enhancement**: Accept optional business_category field
- **Validation**: Category must be from predefined list or null
- **Response**: Same as before - `{ "project_id": "uuid", "status": "created" }`

### Component Specifications
**InputForm Component Enhancement** [Source: architecture/frontend.md#UI Modules]
- **Current state**: Accepts website URLs only
- **Enhancement**: Add business category dropdown
- **Location**: `src/components/InputForm.jsx`
- **New UI element**: Select/dropdown component with predefined options
- **Styling**: Maintain existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- **State management**: Extend existing form state to include category

### File Locations
**Frontend Files**:
- Component to modify: `src/components/InputForm.jsx`
- New constants file: `src/constants/businessCategories.js`
- Tests to update: `src/components/__tests__/InputForm.test.jsx`

**Backend Files**:
- API endpoint to modify: `src/api/projects.py`
- Database model to update: `src/models/project.py`
- New constants file: `src/constants/business_categories.py`
- Tests to update: `tests/api/test_projects.py`
- Migration script: `src/migrations/add_business_category.py`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Maintain existing test patterns from Story 1.1
- Use Jest for React component testing
- Use pytest for FastAPI backend testing
- Test both with and without category selection
- Verify skip functionality works correctly

### Technical Constraints
**Business Category Implementation Notes:**
- Categories should be consistent between frontend and backend
- Use enum-like structure for type safety
- Ensure backward compatibility - existing projects without category should still work
- Category selection impacts prompt generation in future stories (Epic 3)

**From PRD** [Source: prd/4-functional-requirements.md#4.1]:
- "Optional: user provides business category or selects from dropdown"
- This will be used by the Dynamic Prompt Bank Generator to better tailor prompts

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Frontend tests: `src/components/__tests__/InputForm.test.jsx`
- Backend tests: `tests/api/test_projects.py`

### Test Standards  
Follow existing patterns from Story 1.1:
- Comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for API changes
- Component tests for UI updates
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Testing Frameworks
- Jest and React Testing Library for frontend
- pytest for backend
- Use existing mock patterns for database and API calls

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test all predefined business categories can be selected
- Verify "skip" or empty selection works correctly
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing projects
- Test validation rejects invalid categories
- Verify category is properly stored and retrieved
- Test responsive design with new dropdown element
